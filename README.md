# AIA-Public_Space_IAAC, MaCAD-2021
The following repository is the collection of all the data used for evualuation of a Good Public Space. We used NLP, Image segmentation and space syntax analysis.
Our Project deals with the focus on evaluation of the User Perception using ML to understand the notion of a Good Public Space. The questions that we are trying to resolve include What features of a existing Public Space are Users most excited about? To what are the aspects do Users want these features? And overall, how can we integrate the Users feedback into the design process?



The Methodology:
01// NLP: The process of Natural Language Processing involves understanding the underlying information in texts. The NLP method that we used included 2 main analysis ; sentiment and topic modeling. The process of NLP includes following;

01: COLLECTION OF DATASET
02: TOKENIZE DATA
03: REMOVE STOPWORDS
04: STEMMING
05: LEMMATIZATION
06: COUNT VECTORIZATION
07: EDA
08: WORD CLOUD 
09: SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
10: TOPIC MODELING

We ran the Polarity/ Subjectivity Analysis onto the Dataset for each Public Square to get the overall popularity scores. Here, you see the example of Placa de Catalonia that shows the Positive Sentiment for most of the reviews.  But this method needed to still be refined in order to extract meaningful data that could be related to the features of the image segmentation. Hence we trained a LDA model to get coherence values for number of topics in the data and identified the most popular words in each topic. The PCA analysis showed us which are the most distinctive topics from the dataset and we could extract 5 main categories from the data based on PCA.  This was the first part of the analysis , in order to link this data to the features of the image segmentation , we identified the frequency of each popular words in each topic and assigned a value between 0 to 1 based on token values that we got from the PCA analysis.  Here you can see the 14 categories of image segmentation that are relatable to the 5 categories of NLP.
